# Serhii X
Serhii X is a random Roblox script hub (any game/universal) that I made for absolutly no reason.

Here is the script if you wanna use it:

```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoderSerg/Serhii-X/main/main.lua"))()```

and here is the premium version (more updates and features)

```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoderSerg/Serhii-X/main/premium.lua"))()```
